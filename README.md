## ABOUT THE WEBSITE
This website shows the *cause and effects* of **both obesity and sleep deprivation**. However, unlike other sites, ours emphasis the correlation of both topics and how they affect each other. 

## Our vision
My partner and I envision an informed society; knowing how their environment affects the most basic aspect of their lives, their food choice. We hope that this website is enlightening and makes it easier to eat healthy and understand why you have to do that 10 minute ab workout. We hope it provided motivations for you to stay healthy and live longer.

## Our Mission
Growing up, my partner and I struggled with food and often found conflicted research on what was affecting us. We created this website in order to prevent anyone from going through what we felt. We wanted a website with information that any high school student could understand. They would not need to read complex charges or know big, complex words.


We also liked to shed light on an issue that hasnâ€™t been talked about much. In order for people to live healthy, they would need to inform themselves of what is right and wrong. This website should be a stepping stone for people trying to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. However, we still advocate for you to do your own research
