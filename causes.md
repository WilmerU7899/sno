<p>Obesity is caused from someone regularly taking in more calories than their body needs. The body stories the excess energy as body fat and over time that body fat adds up. If someone eats less calories, then burn it, their weight goes down </p>

<h2>Genetics</h2>
<p>Genetics affect the hormones that regulate fat. One genetic that causes obesity is leptin deficiency. Laptin is the hormone that is produced in fat cells and placenta. It controls the weight by signaling the brain to eat less when body fat stores are too high.  If the body cannot produce enough leptin, the brain will not get the signal to eat less, causing you to lose control of how much you eat, which could lead to obesity. The role of leptin replacement as a treatment for obesity is under exploration.</p>
<p>Despite major belief, genetics does not play a major role in obesity. Even though a person is more likely to develop obesity if one or both parent are obese, it can be counteract by a healthy life style. </p>
<p>Genes to obesity risk is small, while obesity to environment risk is huge. Toxic environments can influence people to buy unhealthy foods which would increase their chances of getting obese. “Genes may co-determine who becomes obese, but our environment determines how many become obese.” That’s why obesity prevention efforts should be focused on changing the toxic environment around us, influencing us to make healthier choices. </p>

<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>The time before just before conceiving can have a huge impact on an individual's weight at birth, during childhood and continuing into adulthood. </p>
<p>Childrens with mothers who smoke or who are overweight may have a higher change of being an obese adult. Being breastfed may lower the risk.</p>
<p>Tips for healthy baby weight:</p>
* Strive for a healthy baby weight before pregnancy
* Don’t smoke during pregnancy
* Aim for a reasonable weight gain during pregnancy
* Breastfeed
    * Preferably without liquids for 4-6 months
    * Some breastfeeding for 12 months

<h2>Poor Diet </h2>
<p>A diet high in simple carbs or high in calories can lead to obesity.</p>

<p>Overeating: Overeating can lead to weight gain, especially if the diet is high in fats. Foods high in fat or sugar have high energy density and can contribute to weight gain. In simple words, fast food or sweets have a lot of calories in a small amount of food. </p>

<p>Frequent eating: Scientists have observed that people who eat smaller meals four or five times daily, have lower cholesterol levels and blood sugar levels than people who have two to three large meals a day. One explanation of this is small meals produce stable insulin levels, whereas larger means cause a large spike of insulins after meals.</p>

<p>Simple Carbohydrates: Simple carbs are sugars, fructose, desserts, soft drinks, beer, etc are rapidly absorbed into your bloodstream. This promotes a growth of fat tissue and weight gain by increasing blood glucose levels which in turn stimulate insulin release by the pancreas & insulin. Foods like brown rice, grains, vegetables, and raw fruits have a slower release of insulin since the structure of the carbohydrates are more complex; therefore taking more time to break down. </p>

<p>Fast Food: CARDIA studies followed 3,000 young adults for 13 years. The results showed that people who have higher fast-food-intake levels at the start of the study weigh on average 13 lbs more than people who have lower levels of fast-food-intake.</p>

<p>Skipping breakfast: While the relation betweens skipping breakfast and obesity are inconclusive, study has shown that it increases weight gain and obesity. Skipping breakfast would influence children to get snacks. Children get 27% of their daily calories from snacks, primarily on deserts and sugary drinks.</p> [NIH]("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20237134/")

<p>Fruit Juices: Even those 100% fruit juices, with no added sugar are high in sugar and calories. Havard school of Public health conducted a study which tracked the diet and lifestyle habits of 120,000 men and women for up to 20 years. The conclusion portrayed that people who increase their intake on fruit juices ended up weighing more. </p>[NIH]("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21696306/")

<p>Protein: High protein diet may help with weight control by making them feel more satisfied on fewer calories, greater thermic effect to store burned energy and improve body composition. Protein seems to help people hand on to lean muscle which in turn can boost the amount of energy burned.</p>

<p>Red Meat: High and processed meat are associated with an increased risk in diabetes, colon cancer, and  heart disease.</p>

<p>Tips: (An average adult gains about a pound a year, which is too slow for most people to notice. However, these pounds can add up.)</p>
* Choose minimally processed foods: whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, healthful sources of protein (fish, poultry, beans), and plant oil
* Limit highly processed foods: sugary beverages, refined grains, potatoes, red and processed meats
* Avoid takeout: Fast foods have large proteins at low prices with high palatability and sugar content. 
* Smaller Portion sizes: Study shows that when given larger portion sizes, people tend to eat more. [Oxford]("https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/82/1/236S/4863399")
* Decrease on sugary snacks
* Don’t drink fruit juices or soda
* High protein diet

<h2>Activity </h2>
<p>Being active for at least 30 minutes per day for the majority of the week can lower the risk of obesity. But to stay at a healthy weight, or to lose weight, most people need at least an hour of physical activity per day. </p>
<p>Staying active is not purely someone's choice. Build environments like transportation systems or buildings can influence how much we move around.</p> [NIH]("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19298418/") 

<hr class="major" /> 

<h2>Toxic Environment </h2>
<p>The environment around us can influence what we eat. For example, if it is difficult to access healthy food and easy to access candy from a convenience store, we would tend to gravitate towards the candy. Sometimes marketing for unhealthy foods and sugary drinks are unavoidable. Junk foods can be sold at school, work, or at the corner store. They are also displayed on television which create a desire for the food. Television also causes people to be less active throughout the day, which can also contribute to weight gain. </p>

<p>Nutritious foods could also be more expensive than junk food. In the past 30 years, the price of fruit and vegetables rose much faster than the prices of all other consumer goods in the U.S. At the same time, the price for candy and carbonated drinks declines relative to the other products. This forced people to consume more sugars than whole foods, simply because they could not afford it.</p> [NIH]("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19357400/?dopt=Citation") 

<p>Since fast food chains and convenience stores are on every block, they have become an easy way to get food. However, stores like these often offer less variety at higher prices. The quality of the produce is also lower than supermarkets.  When smaller stores stock healthier foods, people living in that area also eat better.</p>

<p>As you can see, the food environment, what type of food is available and how much it costs and persuade people’s diets. The increased access to cheap and unhealthy food along with the urban lifestyle can lead to obesity and other health conditions. </p>

<h2>Psychological Factors</h2>
<p>For some people emotions might be their cause for overeating. People can have an unhealthy way of processing their emotions by eating food. Boredom, sadness, stress or anger can all cause binge eating. </p>
