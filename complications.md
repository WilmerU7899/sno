<p>Healthy weight sets the foundation for bones, muscles, brain, heart, and others to work smoothly and efficiently for many years. Excess weight ruins almost every aspect of health; from mood and memory to respiratory functions. It also leads to more deadly diseases like diabetes, heart disease and sometimes even cancer. Obesity can have a lot of short and long term effects which could make your life harder. </p>
