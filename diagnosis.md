* Write down each day:
        *The number of hours you slept
        *The number of times per night you woke up
        *How rested you feel after waking up

* People suspected to have sleep deprivation will sleep overnight in the lab in order to monitor their breathing,   blood, heart rate, heart rhythm, muscle activity, brain movement and eye movements during sleep
