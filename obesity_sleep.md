<p>Sleep and obesity have a strong association with each other.</p>


<hr class="major" />


<p>University of Colorado found that when participants slept for about 5 hours a night for a week, they gained on average two pounds. </p>
<p>In adults, sleeping four hours a night, compared with 10 hours a night, appears to increase hunger and appetite — in particular for calorie-dense foods high in carbohydrates. Observational studies also suggest a link between sleep restriction and obesity. Other studies have found similar patterns in children and adolescents. Mayoclinic</p>
<p>A British study followed more than 8,000 children from birth and tracked how many hours they slept. Kids who slept less than 10.5 hours at the age of three has a 45% increase risk of becoming obese by the age of seven, compared to children who slept more then 12 hours at night. NIH</p>
<p>Studies have shown over and over again that when people don’t get enough sleep, they have an increased level of hunger hormones called ghrelin while decreasing leptin, which is the fullness hormone. This biological change can lead to overeating and weight gain. Usatoday Leptin and ghrelin are peripheral(outer) signals directly interacting with the arcuate(curve) nucleus, and ultimately modulating the orexin system activity to decrease and increase food intake. NCBI Orexin is also important as a mediator of appetite; it will increase craving for food and give hormones like leptin to signal fullness. This inhibits orexin which can cause orexin to be a new target for problems associated with appetite like binge eating.</p>
<p>Interestingly, not getting enough sleep has also led to a higher risk of obesity. This is called reverse causation. Studies have found people who sleep longer than the normal may have obesity- related conditions that has resulted in them sleeping longer. Some obesity- related conditions could be apnea, obstructive lung disease, depression, or cancer. NIH NIH</p>
<p>There are many ways that sleep affects body weight.</p>

1. Increasing in Hunger: As shown above, sleep deprivation alters hormones that control hunger by increasing the level of appetite- stimulating hormone and doing the opposite to a satiety- inducing hormone. NIH
2. Giving people more time to eat: Since people who sleep less are awake for a longer period or time, they tend to eat more because they have the time. When their pantry consists of tasty snacks, individuals are tempted to eat them to pass the time. NIH NIH
3. Food Choices: One study of Japanese workers found that workers who slept less than 6 hours a night gravitate towards eating out, having irregular meal patterns, and snacks compared to workers who slept more than 6 hours. NIH
4. Decrease physical activity: Since people are more tired during the day from the lack of sleep, they are more likely to curb their physical activity. NIH People favor watching television rather than working out. NIH

<p>Good sleeping habits can have other benefits too, like increasing alertness at school or work, improving mood, and overall improving the quality of life.</p>
