<h2>Family</h2>
<p>Family is the one that influences children's choices the most. Parents could steer children in the direction of a healthy lifestyle. They could also provide experiences on how to avoid unhealthy food marketing. </p>
<p>One way to start off is by having the healthiest food at home. By stocking the pantry or fridge up with vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and other nutritious foods, kids are more prone to grab them. They can also make being active a daily task. By doing activities like walking to school or going to the park, it could show kids how fun it is to exercise. Finally, parents could make sure their kids get the recommended hours for sleeping, since sleep has been linked to maintaining a healthy weight. </p>

* 1-3 years old: 12 to 14 hours a night
* 3-5 years old: 11 to 13 hours a night
* 5-12 years old: 10 to 11 hours a night
* Adolescents: 8.5 to 9.25 hours a night

<h2>Early Child Care</h2>
<p>During early childhood, children are still developing their taste preferences, learning how to walk and talk, and mimicking the behaviors of their caregivers. This means that this time period is crucial to obesity prevention. </p>
<p>In the United States, about 75% of children spend time in child care, for an average of thirty- five  hours a week. Census Child care providers should educate parents about healthy eating habits and activity habits, while also providing children the environment to do what they praise. They could serve healthy food and limit junk food as well as providing an environment to play and have fun. They can also keep televisions closed and away from areas where children sleep. But adopting these practices, we are giving children the best change to live a healthy lifestyle. </p>
<p>The number of overweight or obese infants or young children increased 32 million globally in 1990 to 41 million in 2016. WHO</p>

<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>**School:**Children spend the majority of their time in school and in their classrooms. Since this is an area they are often in, it should have some healthy choices and opportunity to stay active. School can include healthier lunch options and remove the marketing for unhealthy food. With this and safe walking/ biking routes to school, the chances of kids becoming obese would be significally lower. </p>
<p>**Worksites:** Just like kids, adults also spend the majority of their time in a specific place, that is work. Since they are often in this area, they can be influenced by the people and foods that are around them. Having obesity prevention programs and providing the knowledge to stay healthy, it can help improve productivity, mobility and decrease the amount of sick days taken. </p>
