<p>Healthy Weight Checklist</p>
1.Eat well
Food choices:      -    Whole grains (whole wheat, steel cut oats, brown rice, quinoa)
Vegetables (a colorful variety-not potatoes)
Whole fruits (not fruit juices)
Nuts, seeds, beans, and other healthful sources of protein (fish and poultry)
Plant oils (olive and other vegetable oils)
Drink water or other beverages that are naturally calorie-free.
Limit:		       -    Sugar-sweetened beverages (soda, fruit drinks, sports drinks)
Fruit juice (no more than a small amount per day)
Refined grains(white bread, white rice, white pasta) and sweets
Potatoes (baked or fried)
Red meat (beef, pork, lamb) and processed meats (salami, ham, bacon, sausage)
Other highly processed foods, such as fast food

2.Avoid Overeating
Eat breakfast. Skipping breakfast can usually lead to a rage of hunger in the middle of the day, which would lead to overeating.
Choose small portions and eat slowly. With this method, you can avoid overeating and give time for the stomach to send a signal to the brain saying it's full.
Eat at home. Restaurants tend to have larger portions while having less nutritions.



<p>Having too much fat around the middle would be considered abdominal obesity. This is independent from your BMI. The simplest and most often way to measure abdominal obesity is to measure your waist size. A woman with a waist of 35 inches or higher and a man with a waist that is 40 inches or higher would be considered to have abdominal obesity. </p>

<p>There are three different methods to measure body fat. Two methods were mentioned in the last two paragraphs but the last method requires specialized equipment. One of these machines is the magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] [https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=bodymr] which produces a powerful magnetic field to show a detailed picture of the inside of your body. Another machine is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA] [https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=dexa] or bone densitometry. This is used to measure bone density and bone loss.
