<p>When you fail to sleep you start to acquire sleep debt. For example, if you need 7 hours of sleep per night to function during the day but you only get 5 hours, you have a sleep debt of 2 hours. If this pattern continues for a week you will accumulate a sleep debt og 14 hours. The only way to get rid of this debt is to get more sleep. Depending on how large your sleep debt is, it may take time to fully recover. Although this may be true, the positive effects of paying this debt off will be felt almost instantaneously.</p>
