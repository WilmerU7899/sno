<h2>Why do we sleep?</h2>
<p>Sleeping is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle. It contributes to the proper function of our nervous systems, cognitive abilities and emotional health. We sleep to solidify memories, clear thinkings and normal reactions. During our sleep phrase, our body produces hormones that are necessary to childhood growth and development. These hormones can help build muscle, fight illness and repair any damage we cause to our bodies during the day. It also promotes energy and the metabolism. </p>

<h2>What happens during sleep?</h2>
<p>There are two types of sleep; REM sleep and NREM sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep accounts for 20% to 25% of your sleep, while non-rapid eye movement (NREM) accounts for 75% to 80% of your sleep. Each night you go through four stages of sleep:</p>
* Stage 1, NREM sleep: This stage lasts several minutes, and it involves the change from being awake to being asleep
* Stage 2, NREM sleep: More repeated sleep cycles are spent in this stage than in any other stage. This is a time of light sleep, before entering a deeper sleep.
* Stage 3, NREM sleep: This deep sleep time is needed to feel refreshed during the day. Longer periods of deep sleep tend to occur in the first half of the night.
* REM sleep: The first cycle of REM sleep is around 90 minutes after falling asleep.
